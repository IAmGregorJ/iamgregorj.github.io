            <h2>Data "developer", is what my boss calls me.</h2>
            <p>I love data. I love organizing data. I love putting order into the chaos that our data comes to us, 
                finding patterns and making it beautiful. It may be strange to talk about data being beautiful, 
                but I that is the feeling I get when things fall into place and it just all makes sense.</p>
            <p>I let my curiosity guide me. I have several degrees, 
                none of them related to one another, but I'm happy for all of them.
                Ever since I took my first course in <abbr title="Beginners' All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code">BASIC</abbr> 
                on my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-99/4A" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TI-99/4A</a>
                I've had a special relationship with the keyboard.
                It may have taken me awhile, but I've finally made it.</p>
            <p>I am a programmer.</p>
            <p>Today I work mostly with <abbr title="Extract, Transform, Load">ETL</abbr> but I also develop data-entry tools where needed. 
                The older tools are written in .NET, but lately I've discovered the beauty simplicity of Power Platform,
                which lets me churn out solutions and gives me more time to work backend.</p>
            <p>In my free time I like to travel to places nobody else likes to go. Small towns and regions that 
                seem forgotten, and that most people don't realize are simply amazing.</p>
            <p>I also play chess. Very badly. I still love it and won't stop trying to get better at it.</p>

            <p>I am Gregor J. That's it. A middle-aged second-career programmer just trying to figure things out. 
            Nothing more, nothing less. This is my brutal truth.</p>

            <h1>Projects.</h1>
            <p>Some of the stuff I've worked on can be found on <a href="https://github.com/IAmGregorJ" target ="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>, 
                but there's not really much to see there other than a few things I worked on during my studies. Most everything I do today is protected by government rules 
                at my workplace, so I'm not able to share it publicly. Just trust me, I'm awesome.</p>

        <div class = "categories">
            <h1>Technologies.</h1>
            <p>SQL, SSIS, SSMS, and PowerShell are my daily backend companions, and PowerApps (Power BI, Power Automate and Power Alpps) supplement the frontend when needed.
                During my studies I mostly concentrated on C#/.NET, which I continue working with a bit at my job.</p>
